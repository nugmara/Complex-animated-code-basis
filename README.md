This JavaScript code demonstrates how to create an HTML5 canvas and draw animated lines with various colors and patterns. It uses the Canvas 2D API to achieve this effect.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- A web browser that supports HTML5 canvas (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

### Installation

1. Download the code or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. The canvas will appear on the page, and animated lines will start drawing.

## Usage

This code creates an HTML5 canvas and draws animated lines with the following features:

- Global settings for line width and canvas shadows.
- Gradients for line colors.
- A pattern for line stroke.
- Each line is randomly generated with varying properties, including length, speed, and color.
- Lines continuously change their direction and appearance over time.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the animation by modifying the JavaScript code:

- Adjust the number of lines by changing the `numberOfLines` variable.
- Modify the gradient colors in `gradient1` and `gradient2` to achieve different color effects.
- Change the `patternImage` by providing a different image source for the pattern.
- Experiment with different properties of the `Line` class to create unique line behaviors.
